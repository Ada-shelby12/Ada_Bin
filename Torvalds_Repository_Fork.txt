To add your code to a repository owned by Linus Torvalds (such as torvalds/linux), you generally cannot push directly unless you have collaborator access. Here’s how you can contribute code:

1. **Fork the Repository**  
   Go to the torvalds repository (e.g., [torvalds/linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux)) and click the “Fork” button. This creates a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.

2. **Clone Your Fork Locally**  
   Copy the URL of your fork and run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/linux.git
   cd linux
   ```

3. **Create a New Branch**  
   It’s best practice to create a feature branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-feature-branch
   ```

4. **Add Your Code**  
   Make your changes or add your code using your preferred editor.

5. **Commit and Push Your Changes**  
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Describe your change"
   git push origin my-feature-branch
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**  
   Go to your fork on GitHub, and you’ll see a “Compare & pull request” button. Click it to open a PR against torvalds/linux. Fill out the PR template with details of your change.

7. **Wait for Review**  
   Maintainers will review your PR. Follow any requested changes and communicate respectfully.

**Notes:**  
- For major projects like Linux, you may need to follow specific contribution guidelines.  
- Your PR should be well-tested and documented.  
- Large projects often have mailing lists or additional steps for contributions.
